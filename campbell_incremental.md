1.  First iteration would be the basic outline of the interface with the classes already setup (minus specific commands)
(With each iteration I would add an integral part of the final product)
2.  For example, first I would add a class and test it's functions(Adding the database first is too agressive. The classes haven't even been tested yet)
3.  Then the next iteration would incorporate the database with the students and allow for classes to be filled
4.  The next iteration would complete the specific commands each class has and incorporate them with the database of classes(I think it would be best if the database was last. Make sure all of the classes work before storing and accessing a database)
5.  This would continue for any other things that might come up along the way

<!-- When do you plan to incorporate the database for course? - Tam Ngo -->
<!-- Do all Iterations take about the same time or do they take longer or shorter depending on the task? - Tam Ngo-->
