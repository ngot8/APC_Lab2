We'll add our process models here in the main branch labeled as such: lastname_processname.
Make sure to add .md at the end so you can use github functions like making mermaid flow chart.


*Comment* I like this idea, the gantt charts and flowcharts seem to work well with this type of graph. I'd recommend adding in some written details to help make each stage more developed
