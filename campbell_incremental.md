1.  First iteration would be the basic outline of the interface with the classes already setup (minus specific commands)
(With each iteration I would add an integral part of the final product)
2.  For example, first I would add the database with classes and test
3.  Then the next iteration would incorporate the database with the students and allow for classes to be filled
4.  The next iteration would complete the specific commands each class has and incorporate them with the database of classes
5.  This would continue for any other things that might come up along the way
