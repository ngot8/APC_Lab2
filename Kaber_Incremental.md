Incremental Model:
	The incremental model would be the barebones menu at the start. 
	It would allow the user to test and set users. 
	This is to verify that the interactive element is solid. 
	For the intermediate implementations, the iterations would add more functions to each of the users. 
	It would make sure each role’s permissions function properly. 
	The most important part being the ability to change their own schedules. 
	Then changing each other’s. 
	The database functions would need to be added in the final version.
